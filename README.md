## 🎯 About

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at WGU, with CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications. This repository reflects my hands-on progress in cybersecurity labs, particularly in:

- Incident Detection & Response
- Network Enumeration
- Exploitation & Privilege Escalation
- Threat Intelligence
- Linux & Windows Security Fundamentals

Each write-up includes step-by-step methodology, lessons learned, and real-world parallels.
